   <b>Escape Test Description string?</b>
   <p>If checked, the plug-in escapes the description string associated with the test method while displaying test method details.</p>
   <p>If unchecked, this allows you to use HTML tags to format the description. (Enabled by default)</p>
   <p>However, if this field is unchecked, you are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack through an HTML test description.</p>
